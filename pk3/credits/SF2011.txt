MAP01  - Apple Acres
Author - Grain of Salt
Music  - Akira Yamaoka -- "Not Tomorrow", from Silent Hill. MIDI file from
         vgmusic.
Comments: Inspired by an old, unreleased megawad called “The End”.
Commander Keen. Maple Story. A train station. A book of rubbish ghost
stories I once had. And, finally, the dark section of Phml’s MAP25 directly
influenced my decision to use an empty void for a sky.

A remake of a speedmap that was itself a remake of a speedmap. What annoys
me about this map is that the sections after the first fight should be
*more* chaotic. I wanted to preserve the ridiculous cyber/archvile free for
all that existed in the very oldest version (now lost in the mists of
time), but it just didn’t work out. There is also a hedgemaze in this map
Oh well, at least the first room plays alright.

Tested by gggmork, dannebubinga and Phml. Build time: Maybe three days. No
bugs that I know of.

===========================================

MAP02  - Control Freak
Author - Grain of Salt
Music  - Kevin Schilder -- "SWAMPR", from Hexen.
Comments: Inspired by Hexen, Julian Plenti is... Skyscraper, and
half-remembered mansion-esque maps from Quake and Hexen 2 (the part
inspired by that got deleted, though...)

I wanted to make a map which would have one small, symmetrical room
repeated 1700 times (don’t ask), but eventually I got sick of that idea
and ended up with this instead. Early versions featured nothing but Hell
Knights and a tide of Cacodemons that eventually filled the map from
outside, but that was too much like Bananabread, so I got rid of it. This
version is two rows and two columns smaller, and a lot lighter on the
monsters, but still pretty unforgiving if you don’t play precisely.
Features an unused voodoo mechanism which lowered the central pillars in
older versions and warped in two cyberdemons. Or possibly three. Nearly my
favourite map. And if we had dozens more maps to choose from for this
project, this is the only one of mine besides MAP16 that I would keep.

Tested by: Phml and gggmork. Build time: 4 or 5 hours, with some minimal
tidying over the following weeks. No bugs that I know of.

===========================================

MAP03  - Lull
Author - Grain of Salt
Music  - Kevin Schilder -- "DEEPR", from Hexen.
Comments: Inspired by Hexen, and Hexen: Deathkings, and something else I
can't remember.

Not hard enough, and too much like Control Freak, but it’s still quite
pretty, and I like it. Again, this came from trying to make a room that
could repeat 1700 times. One day this will make sense. Besides that,
gggmork’s version is better. Go play that.

Tested by: Phml. Build time: About 4 hours. No bugs that I know of.

===========================================

MAP04  - North
Author - Grain of Salt
Music  - Kevin Schilder -- "E2M4", from Heretic.
Comments: Inspired by Heretic and... David Bowie?

So apparently we’re in the arctic now.

Tested by: gggmork and Phml. Build time: 3 hours on some gloomy morning.
No bugs that I know of.

===========================================

MAP05  - Eyes and Ears
Author - Grain of Salt
Music  - Yasunori Mitsuda -- "The Girl Who Stole The Stars", from Chrono
Cross. MIDI file from vgmusic, slightly edited by me, for volume, and to
postpone the flute (?) melody at the start.
Comments: Inspired by nothing I can remember. Probably some kind of music.

This map was once ridiculously hard. The pillared cyberdemons used to be
groups of about nine archviles. The HKs were revenants. But it was just
unpleasant to play, so I toned it down quite a lot. This version is still
a bit evil, but not so bad.

Tested by: UnholyMessias, Phml and dannebubinga. Build time: 4 hours. No
bugs that I know of.

===========================================

MAP06  - Earthquake
Author - Grain of Salt
Music  - Lee Jackson -- "Stalag 3D", from Duke Nukem 3D.
Comments: Inspired by Quake, “Homonculus” by Xiu Xiu, general Halloween
themes, a Quake deathmatch map I remember from 1999, from a pack of maps
called something like “Time to Kill”...? Or maybe “Countdown... something”.
It was on a CD. Help me out here.

Anyway. This map is quite hard. It also looks pretty drab and pointless. In
the end, I just couldn’t get that much detail out of the Quake textures.
There aren’t enough textures there that work together. 

Tested by: Phml and dannebubinga. Build time: 5 hours. In terms of bugs...
if you idclip and go stand on the cliffs, you can make the sky look weird.
But why would you do that?

===========================================

MAP07  - Lull Remix
Author - Grain of Salt
         gggmork
Music  - Descent, Music 18.
Comments: *censored*

===========================================

MAP08  - Metsu
Author - dannebubinga
Music  - TNT map 06
Comments: This started as a speed map in the vein of Hell Revealed. I
didn't complete it so when this project started I used the map as a base
for a longer slaughtermap. 

Metsu is named after Ryu's ultra combo in Street Fighter 4 which is called
Metsu Hadoken. Metsu meaning "destruction", sums up what this map is all
about - demolish the fucking place and get the hell out of there. 

Works in coop, but not playtested.

Tested by Phml, gggmork and Bloodite Krypto (thanks guys).

===========================================

MAP09  - Ginipiggu
Author - dannebubinga
Music  - Plutonia map 21
Comments: A simple slaughter-ish attempt on a circle of death tribute, made
in a very short time borderlining on speed map. 

Also known as "Videopung" which is quite funny if you understand swedish.
Later went for anoher japanese/english name which of course is
"Guinea Pig". 

Works in coop, but not playtested.

Tested by Phml

===========================================

MAP10  - True Violence
Author - dannebubinga
Music  - Plutonia map 2
Comments: My first time using the q1tex resource. It turned out quite nice
and plays very well too. This map is very inspired by my fellow mapper
"Grain of Salt" who uses these textures in a very tasteful way. 

Works in coop, but not playtested. The YK fight may break when in coop
mode, but I don't know how 2 players would fit in there anyway. Player may
also get stuck in the BK room if the player uses an AV jump to the coop
teleporter leading to the BK room.

Tested by Phml, Grain of Salt and Memfis (many thanks for that!).

===========================================

MAP11  - Satsui No Hado
Author - dannebubinga
Music  - Descent (d cent06)
Comments: The nerd inside of me thought that I should pay another homage
name-wise to the Street Fighter series. A big tech-base structure with
gallons of cooling water running everywhere and tons of Hell Knights. The
map is also a response to recent discussions about symmetry and how you've
failed as a mapper if you implement it. What I think about symmetry is
after playing this map - kind of obvious. 

Works in coop, but not playtested.

Tested by Phml.

===========================================

MAP12  - Ultra
Author - dannebubinga
Music  - Descent (d cent09)
Comments: A speedmap inspired by phmlspd. It may not look that way, but
that's how I thought while I was mapping. I wanted the map to look like a
phmlspd map, but when I threw in the jungle textures to spice it up a bit,
it became quite abstract. A pretty poor looking map tbh, plays quite good
for fast maxes and speed runs though. 

Works in coop, but not playtested.

Tested by Phml and Grain of Salt.

===========================================

MAP13  - Kama Sutra Lite
Author - Memfis
Music  - MUS_E2M3 (slowed down a bit) from Heretic [created by Kevin
         Schilder]
Comments: Just a little tribute to one of the most original KS maps. Made
at russian 4 hour speedmapping event, with small corrections made soon
after.

===========================================

Music  -
Comments: This was a, well, different style map than I usually make! It's

Comments: DH85 - This was a speedmap for the project and I'm glad people
took the time to flesh it out a little.

Grain of Salt - Inspired by my own maps. Windows 95. Duke Nukem 3D.

Finally a good map! In July, when nothing much had happened yet in SF2011,
DoomHero85 (that’s General Rainbow Bacon to you) released a speedmap called
“Butt Donuts”. Much later, when we were compiling the beta releases, j4rio
was generally unsatisfied by the DH85 maps we were looking at, and released
a fix to make this one beatable, as well as adding a few interesting
fights. I played j4rio’s version, and I started having ideas for how to
detail it, so I loaded up Doom Builder, and a few hours later I had this.
As well as the detailing, I tweaked the beginning fight quite a lot, I took
out a couple of areas that didn’t work, and I shuffled the order of things
around. So essentially, DoomHero created the shape of the map, j4rio fixed
the gameplay, and I made it look pretty. In terms of aesthetics, it’s
basically a rip-off of my Green Goddess maps, but no one played Green
Goddess so I think we’re safe. I love the MIDI piano on this track. Ahhhh.

Tested by: Phml and j4rio. Build time: Four hours of detailing. A few days
of tweaks and discussion. No bugs that I know of.

Comments: A couple years back, I made several speedmaps. Not being big on
intellectual property and all that stuff, I explicitely said anyone was
free to do with these as they wished.

Now, some people thought it meant they could take the wad and haphazardly
throw a bunch of monsters in it, completely destroying balance ; and so far
all of that is fine, more power to them if they enjoy it that way.

Then comes the annoying part: the original wad was named Phmlspd (creative,
isn't it), and our fellows, which we'll assume were just appalled at the
astounding amount of effort required to change a wad title, decided to just
stick a version number at the end of it, call it a day and host it on
Skulltag.

Not only making it look like that sorry mess was condoned by me, but that
it was the official thing, and that I was directly responsible for this
atrocity. Yeah. Thank you very much, guys.

So I bitched about it, still respectfully and all at this point, on the
Skulltag forums, pointing out I wasn't so hot on the wad being tied to my
name. Whoever was involved didn't bother to answer, and for a few days it
seemed like the situation wasn't about to change any.

Suddenly, the (Skulltag) wad name changed. 

To... Chillax.

Oh, it. Is. ON.

And so, Cat. A remix of Phmlspd map01, filled to the brim with monsters,
with several new areas and redesigns of the old ones. Gritty redesigns,
because if Hollywood told us something, reboots must be angsty.

Following that thought, the secret area was a homage of sorts to some of
ToD's maps, trying to grasp an eerie feeling of something that went
terribly wrong and resulted in this black, soulless dimension filled with
nothing but blood and monsters. Well, there's the blood and the monsters.

Difficulty settings roughly implemented: HMP is like UV with more powerups
and a few problematic monsters gone. HNTR is intended as a walk in the
park / tourist difficulty; although there's still shit to shoot. Co-op
starts are there, but no playtesting or balancing has been done, save for
removing the BFG (which in itself should make a sizeable difference).

===========================================

MAP26  - Mouse
Author - Phml
Music  - "The Jade Emperor", Secret of Evermore
Comments: Huge, dead temple.

Let's get this out of the way, the texture scheme is ripped straight out of
Sunder Map11. 

And *I* asked permission, thank you very much. 

...Sorry. I'll behave.

Back to the point: if you like anything about the aesthetics, Insane Gazebo
is the one to thank for it ; and in that case, you ought to check Sunder if
you haven't already. If, on the other hand, you think this map is complete
junk, throw your rotten apples at me. I can't come close to the level of
artistic skill the man has, and picking the same pieces to build with only
makes the above that much more obvious.

There's been many ideas, some discarded and some kept from the start, as it
took an ungodly 3 months or so to get this done. 10-20 minutes a day at a
time, admittedly, as not to yell in disgust and discard the whole thing
while it looked like I was getting nowhere with it. The plan was to have a
layout that'd tie back on itself in a way that fight dynamics could heavily
change based on where and when you choose to fight ; a maze-ish environment
with lowering walls triggered by walkover lines rather than switches, which
along with the scale was an attempt to build on the lab mouse thing.

While the set pieces were there, the gameplay was somewhat lacking in
certain parts. Thankfully, dannebubinga single-handedly saved this map. He
did a lot of playtesting during the final month, gave a lot of feedback,
got me to consider and rework various stuff I wouldn't have thought of
myself. Of course, he's not the only one who's been providing valuable
feedback, and much thanks to everyone involved. It's just that danne's
contribution was so critical to the result it'd be wrong not to acknowledge
its extent.

Difficulty settings roughly implemented: HMP is like UV with more powerups
and a few problematic monsters gone. HNTR is a bit easier still. Co-op
starts are there, but no playtesting or balancing has been done.

Comments: [TD] An attempt to make the biggest map with the largest possible
enemy count I could. I originally aimed to surpass Holy Hell, but I only
reached just above 3/4 of its monster count I made the fatal mistake of
testing with ZDoom, so when I switched to prBoom most of the enemies
couldn't move because of how close they were to each other. I eventually
just left it out for some else to finish.

Music  - Ellinia Forest, from Maple Story. MIDI file from vgmusic.
Comments: Inspired by nothing.

I spent about twenty minutes making a detailed 64x64 segment of stairs, and
then I copy-pasted it into a big arena and filled it with stuff for some
reason. The music here was the music I used for a very early version of
Apple Acres, and I was sorry to see it go, so I found a space for it on
this map, which never really had a track associated with it. It’s not a
complex map. Just run, fire and stay alive.

Tested by: gggmork and Phml. Build time: Less than 2 hours. No bugs that I
know of.

Other wads - Green Goddess, which was never completed, and was released
             only on the forums, and MAP25 of Progressive Fiction, which
             isn't going to come out for a while. So, in effect...
             nothing. :)
Comments   - First off, I've got to thank the other members of the team for
their contributions. We were lucky enough to get some of the best slaughter
mappers around, and I'm thankful I got to work on something with them.
Really, what other project is ever going to have new maps by TimeOfDeath,
Phml and gggmork at the same time?

SF2011 gives me a pretty strong Hell Revealed 2 vibe. We have similar
gameplay, a similar mix of maps, and we even have a third episode that
starts off gothic and segues into a surreal, scaled-up classic theme. All
we're missing is a ridiculous IoS map at the end. Actually, why did no one
do that? Come on, that would have been great. In terms of map variation,
this is one of the strangest megawads I've ever seen. We have some maps
with barely any thought given to the gameplay or aesthetics, and we have
some maps that are extraordinary works of art in every respect. Luckily,
most maps here are pretty solid, thanks to people like Phml and
dannebubinga ravenously testing everything they can get hold of. There are
weird lapses, but I guess that was inevitable in a project this open. I'm
looking forward to SF2012, which will have twice as long to gather maps,
and will therefore hopefully be able to avoid getting stuck with unfinished
speedmaps. SF2012 could well be the last version of the project involving
broadly this group of mappers, so we'd better make it a good one.

Now pick a map and record something.

Comments   - This was really a fun project to work on, mostly because it
was a different type of gameplay than I usually do. Now, I know I will
probably not be able to beat a single map from this mapset, but I think it
will be a good challenge for hardcore doomers. I hope the players have as
much fun playing it as I did making my map for it.
