Other Files By Author   : SL (shai'tan's luck), celticmansion, some dwspd maps in 22-24, a few maps in pcorf's community project (also in-progress), some more maps in the 1994 remake challenge (also in-progress), a few odds-and-ends elsewhere
Misc. Author Info       : Bio major, fantasy/sci fi fanatic.
Description             : My little repository of insane slaughter maps. Movement 1 released because I wanted to focus on Uacultra 2 with 40oz. So about the maps, this wad contains 18 gothic, industrial, or hell-themed maps, many are actually a bit of a combination of themes. Expect numbers of monsters around the largest slaughter maps you've encountered, or possibly more. But the gameplay in most will be a little easier cause I overstock powerups. 
Additional Credits to   : gothicteam for gothictx, decontex and ogrodtex authors, 40oz for ultratex. Big thanks to phml, gggmork, anima zero, and lately rjy for a lot of testing and dealing with the random crap I throw into my maps ;) All the authors in the midi list are awesome, and so is doomhero85 for uploading midi versions of the two slayer songs and incantations of fire, which I used. And just now entryway, for releasing a test version of prboom just so it runs my map xD

* Construction *
Base                    : New from scratch
Build Time              :  10 months, off and on. Average time to map a map was 2-3 weeks. Bugfixing took another  month +
Editor(s) used          : DB2, XWE, WINTEX 3.4
Known Bugs              : maps 13,15, and 21 can experience slowdowns on less powerful computers, and the eastern caves part of map21 causes slowdown for everyone who has played it. 
May Not Run With        : maps 13 and 21 requires prboom/+ 2.5.0.7 or newer because it uses zdbsp -extended nodes. Other maps can be played on older versions. Additionally a new version (2.5.0.9 test) fixes the dying and crashing bug on 21.
Tested With             : prboom+ 2.5.0.7/9, skulltag, probably gzdoom at some time
