Description             : Originally I made map27 and called it Area42, and the whole project Area42, as the story then was set a few years after doom2, when UAC is cleaning up the bases it lost control of when the demons invaded. But that expanded into a minimally-plot driven episode spanning a  short 'training mission' that ends with you teleported to the sewers of a different base, travels through that base and some more places on the way to Area42, and from there the player descends to hell through the fortifications of Atlantis and then the lost city itself. And hell isn't exactly your traditional MAP30 ...

Additional Credits to   : In chrono order, jodwin and super jamie for testing and bearing with my noob mistakes on MAP27; gggmork coming in for about the rest of the project for testing of maps, especially when making 28-30; a few other people on the forums who tested and Insane_Gazebo in the last week who pointed out some things in 28-30; For RESOURCES - GothicDM people for making such a great texture wad; Jimmy91 for Torque, the midi for MAP24; knightrider of doom for midis for maps 20, 25, 26, 28, and 30; People on the editing forum for some random stuff; and finally you can't forget id for doom.
